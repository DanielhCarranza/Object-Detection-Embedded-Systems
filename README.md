# Object Detection inference in Embedded Systems
Globally, it is estimated that there are more than 180 millions of people with severe visual impairment, where approximately 45 million of them are blind. By definition, blind people cannot walk without help or any other kind of support. The obstacles, the lack of opportunities and independence they are facing is too high. Thatâ€™s the reason why we decide to create a system that help blind people recover their independence and augment their capabilities through an intelligent assistance system that allow them to do their daily tasks, just like:  read text, manage money, face and object recognition, location, navigation, scene recognition and description. All of this is achieved by making algorithms like Text Detection, Recognition, Object Detection, Image Classification, Face Recognition, Text to Speech, Image Captioning.

This part of the project is focused on **Object Detection in a Raspberry Pi** as part of the first prototype for the device.  

Stack used: Tensorflow, TensorflowLite, Estimators for training, OpenCV for image processing, Raspberry pi 3, GCP.
